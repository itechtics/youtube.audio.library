As the name suggests, the **YouTube Audio Library** is a collection of audio tracks such as music and sound effects that you can use in your videos. These sounds are available to use under a free license, which means that you can use them without having to worry about copyright strikes or demonetization. 


## What You Can Find in the YouTube Audio Library

There are two main types of audio tracks that you can find in the YouTube Audio Library–free music and sound effects. Let’s take a closer look at what each of these categories entails.

### Free Music
Under the Free Music tab, you can find thousands of music that are free to use in your videos without the risk of copyright infringement. Just above the list of tracks, you can find the different filters associated with the tracks such as genre, mood, artist, duration, license type, and recency. This allows you to understand what you can expect from each track that’s listed below. For example, you can determine if a track is calm, has been added recently, and can be categorized under rock.


From the search box above, you can add different filters to narrow down the ideal track for your video. Here’s what you can do with each of the filters:

* **Track title –** This allows you to search for tracks that contain a certain keyword or phrase in the title.
* **Genre –** This allows you to search for tracks based on genres such as alternative and punk, ambient, children’s, cinematic, classical, country and folk, dance and electronic, hip-hop and rap, holiday, jazz and blues, pop, R&B and soul, reggae, and rock.
* **Mood –** This allows you to search for tracks based on the mood that it evokes such as angry, bright, calm, dark, dramatic, funky, happy, inspirational, romantic, or sad.
* **Artist name –** This allows you to search for tracks from specific artists.
* **Duration –** This allows you to find tracks longer than or shorter than a specific duration.



### Sound Effects

If you need to enhance your video using sound effects, there are hundreds of suitable tracks under the Sound Effects tab. This library allows you to get really specific with your sounds. For example, you can find sound effects for a male zombie roar, a cartoon metal thunk, or a truck driving in a parking structure.

Under this tab, you can filter your search based on track title, category, and duration. The category filter allows you to find different sound effects such as alarms, ambiances, animals, cartoons, crowds, doors, emergency, foley, horror, household, human voices, impacts, office, science fiction, sports, tools, transportation, water, weapons, and weather. 

## Reasons to Use the YouTube Audio Library

Now you may be wondering whether it’s a good idea to use tracks from the YouTube Audio Library. Here are some of the main reasons why you may want to consider this option.

### Lower Risk of Copyright Strikes

The audio tracks are available under a free license, which means that YouTube makes the tracks available to you for free provided that you follow the rules. So as long as you follow the YouTube Terms of Service and the rules laid out for using tracks from the Audio Library, you won’t face any copyright strikes on the audio.

That means you can avoid serious copyright-related trouble in the long run if you use these tracks. As such, you have the peace of mind that the sounds you use won’t land you in hot water later on.  

### Affordable Solution for Novice Content Creators

If you’re just starting to make YouTube videos, you may have major budget restrictions. Since you’re already investing huge amounts of money on equipment and other essentials, additional spending on music and sound effects may be out of the question. The YouTube Audio Library offers an affordable alternative for novice content creators to add relevant sounds to their video content.

While major content creators may have the budget to invest in original and licensed music tracks, the sounds available in the Library are still a great option if you’re just starting out. As you gradually grow your channel and are able to make more money out of it, you can consider paid alternatives.

### Lower Risk of Demonetization

YouTube still allows you to monetize your videos even if you use audio from the Audio Library, provided that you’re eligible for monetization in the first place. The main benefit is that the sounds you use from the Library won’t result in your video getting demonetized further down the line as long as you’re giving the necessary attribution and getting the requisite permission in case of any modification.
